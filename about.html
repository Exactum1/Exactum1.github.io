        <h1> About Our Prototype </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p> <h4> Exactum is built on the premise of sending Window popups, when websites of YOUR choosing update. </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> Can’t wait to listen to the latest release of your favourite podcast, but don’t want to keep refreshing forever? Exactum’s got you covered. </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> Want to be notified when a stock you’ve been eyeing for a while change price? Exactum’s got it in the bag. </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> Can’t be bothered checking when your teacher or professor posts a new online assignment? Trivial for Exactum. </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> Want to organize your alerts for specific websites? Exactum will send you the emails of website changes
            so you can organize them whatever way you like! </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4>  These are just some of the countless uses that Exactum has to offer, and as we roll out more features,
            you’re sure to find more creative uses. So, give it a try! The skies the limit when you use Exactum. </h4> </p>
        <br>
        <p> <h4> As we were limited to a 36-hour competition, there is still a plethora of new features
            that we would like to roll out to improve Exactum. </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> One of the ways we thought we could improve Exactum was to develop it as a Google Chrome Extension. </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> This would make it easier-to-access for all users, as well as provide no need to download
            any of the running files. </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> We also recognize that not everyone has the same preferences, so we would like to
            implement more ways to contact people with alerts other than the popups and emails.</h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> Lastly, the final feature we hope to include in the future is a line-by-line
            difference of change, similar to how GitHub does it. </h4> </p>
        <p> <h4> This would allow for a more comprehensive analysis of when a website is updated,
            and would overall provide a cleaner, smoother experience for our users. </h4> </p>
